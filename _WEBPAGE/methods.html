        <p>The methods I used to create this object and website were fairly simple. After trying out a few 3D object-creating-apps, I decided to use Tilt Brush, as it was easy for beginners to use. I got the hand of it pretty quickly, and finished building my 3D object in about five lessons (spending about two hours on it).</p>
        
        <p>I created the website with brackets, a tool for coding html, css and js. This made my work much faster with its built-in assisting functions.
        </p>
        
        <p>I uploaded my 3D object to Sketchfab and embedded it with code generated by Sketchfab that linked back to it.</p>
        
        <p>I did not face many difficulties. However, a problem I couldn't solve was that section 10 on my clock failed to appear after I uploaded it. It is apparently a bug because it appears normally when viewing it in VR mode.</p>
